# Naval_Mine_Identifier
Neural Network model to predict whether it is a rock or mine?

Dependencies:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Scikit-Learn
4. Tensorflow
5. Matplotlib

The dataset contains 208x60 of numeric data with the 61st column depicting the class i.e rock or mine. In this experiment I have used 4 hidden layers and optimized the cost function using Gradient Descent at learning rate of 0.05

This model generates a training accuracy of 99.3939 and test accuracy of 83.333. Although this result can be further improved by solving the overfitting of data during training.

Apart from this, there is another program which shows on how to use the saved model on the data.
